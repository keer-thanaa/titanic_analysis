# Titanic Dataset Analysis 🚢

This is my first dataset analysis, where I explored the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The goal was to understand basic data cleaning and visualization techniques — and to draw some insights from the data.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📌 What I Did

- Cleaned the dataset (handled missing values, dropped unnecessary columns)
- Created visualizations to understand relationships between features and survival
- Drew simple insights based on patterns in the data

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 💡 **Women had a higher survival rate** compared to men  
- 💡 **Passengers in 3rd class had a higher number of survivors**, possibly due to more people traveling in that class
- 💡 Survival was influenced by gender and class more than other factors

## 📁 Files

- `titanic_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with the full code
- `README.md` – This file

## 📚 Dataset Source

## ✨ What's Next?

This marks the beginning of my personal challenge to analyze **one dataset every day** and share my learnings here and on LinkedIn.
